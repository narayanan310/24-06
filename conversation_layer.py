"""
conversation_layer.py
Handles small talk, greetings, farewells, and out-of-scope requests.

Runs BEFORE the SLM so casual language never triggers a hallucinated
vehicle command.

New in this version
────────────────────
• Out-of-scope replies for all known non-vehicle domains.
• "I still need to drive home" — contextual safety response.
• "I meant inside / I meant the temperature" handled by DialogueManager
  (not here — those are repair signals).
